TPatterns should compile and install cleanly on any UNIX variant.  I have
tested it on:

IRIX 6.4
Linux
Solaris 2.5

INSTRUCTIONS
============

1.  Edit the Makefile to set your installation target directories,
    and any compiler flags you want.  If you already have PCRE 1.09 or
    later installed on your computer, you can use that and skip
    step 2.

2.  Go into the pcre-x.xx directory, and modify its Makefile (this
    will probably not be necessary)

3.  Change back to this directory, and type:

    make
    make install

4.  Create a suitable FASTLIBS file, and set the FASTLIBS environment
    variable to point to it.  A brief description of the format can be
    found in the manpage.
